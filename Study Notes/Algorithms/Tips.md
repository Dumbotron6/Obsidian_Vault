* Keep practicing.
* Consider all points in the question.
* If one approach doesn't yield results, wipe mind and look for alternate approach.
* Write down working solution and then optimize it. Can't get perfect time complexity solution in first try.
* Try to reduce number of steps, not add more -- optimization.
* Think of edge cases!
* Go with brute force method first. Optimize later.
* When doing traversal problems, keep track of direction of movement using flags.
